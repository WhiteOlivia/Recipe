    <img src= "Img/Cheese" height=300 alt="Fully baked Mac n' Cheese" />
    <h3> Ingredients </h3> 
    <ul> 
        <li> 1 ¾ pounds whole-wheat macaroni </li>

       <li> ¾ cup butter </li>

       <li>  ¾ cup all-purpose flour </li>

       <li> 6 cups milk, divided </li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce </li>

       <li> 1 teaspoon mustard powder </li>

       <li>  1 teaspoon onion powder </li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>

       <li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>

        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided </li>

        <li> 3 (8 ounce) packages shredded American cheese </li>

        <li> 1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (such as Lay's®), crushed </li>

        <li> 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese </li>

        <li> ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>

        <li> butter-flavored cooking spray </li> 
   </ul> 
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
      </li>
    
    </ol>
